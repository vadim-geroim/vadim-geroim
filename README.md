## About Me
Hello! I'm **Vadim Geroim**, an accomplished web developer with a rich 15-year history in the tech industry, where I have honed my skills in both front and backend development. My career has largely been focused on e-commerce and educational technology sectors, particularly in online tutoring and test preparation platforms. A career highlight for me has been my contributions to educational projects, which have been instrumental in helping students enhance their skills and gain admission to US colleges.

I am deeply passionate about designing user interfaces that are not only visually engaging but also intuitive and user-friendly, striving to create seamless online experiences that truly meet users' needs.

Personally, I am very family-oriented and have a keen interest in the culinary arts. I enjoy preparing a variety of dishes, especially those from Iranian, Caucasian, and Turkish cuisines, reflecting my love for experiencing different cultures through their food.

I'm looking forward to bringing my blend of technical skills and creative insights to your next project!

Please feel free to reach out to me at vgerom.job@gmail.com for any collaboration, project inquiries, or just to connect. I'm always open to discussing new opportunities and ideas.
